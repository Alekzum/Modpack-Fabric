# Information about the modpack 
[![ru](https://img.shields.io/badge/lang-ru-blue.svg)](https://github.com/Alekzum/Modpack-Fabric/blob/main/README.ru.md)

I just saw [this mod](https://modrinth.com/mod/modpack-update-checker) and thought about it: "And why not", and now it has been updated README.md and I also study a little bit at Markdown.

# What should I do with the files?
- Select the desired version (for example 1.1.0)
- Download the `mods` folder from here (somehow, good luck)
- We shove it into the root folder of your minecraft (for me it's `%appdata%\.minecraft`)
- From there we download the folder `modpack-update-checker` (we download it in the same way as mods... good luck)
- Push this into the `config` folder, in the root folder of your minecraft
- Launching your minecraft (in this case Fabric 1.21)
- Hooray, now you have my modpack, here's a medal for you ðŸ¥ˆ
