# Information about the modpack
I just saw [this one](https://modrinth.com/mod/modpack-update-checker ) Maud thought about it: "And why not", and now it has been updated README.md And I'm also studying at Markdown on the sly.

# What should I do with the files?
- Select the desired version (for example 1.1.0)
- Download the `mods` folder from here (somehow, good luck)
- We shove it into the root folder of your minecraft (for me it's `%appdata%\.minecraft`)
- From there we download the folder `modpack-update-checker` (we download the same as mods... good luck)
- Push this into the `config` folder, in the root folder of your minecraft
- Launching your minecraft (in this case Fabric 1.21)
- Hooray, now you have my modpack, here's a medal for you ðŸ¥ˆ
